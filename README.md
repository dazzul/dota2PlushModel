# Dota2PlushModel  

Basic simulation to show random distribution in the sale of dota2 merch.  
Two apps, one runs simulations, the other combines results into averages.  

If you run this yourself then you're going to need to set the paths to your own userspace, otherwise it will create folders for a user called "username".
